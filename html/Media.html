                                    the entire website, as well as wrote some content for it. Apart from robotics,
                                    I am on the cross country, track and swim teams in school. This season, my goal
                                    is to win at least one of the many Online Challenges so that my team can qualify
                                    for the 2020 VEX World Championship! This is my last year of high school, and I plan
                                    to make this a fantastic season that I'll never forget.

                                    My name is Martin Alexiev, and this is my second year in robotics. 
                                    Last year, I originally began as media taking video as well as 
                                    making videos for the entire team. Then, I quickly progressed and became 
                                    a builder for 200X. This year I became Captain of 200H hoping to 
                                    lead the team to its first ever World Championship. The other extracurriculars 
                                    I do are ice hockey, yearbook, and DECA in which I am all passionate towards. 
                                    This is my last year in high school making it my last year in LanceBotics. 
                                    With that in mind, I’m putting in 200% into this team, making sure we have 
                                    the best possible season!

I’ve contributed as a jack-of-all trades programmer, builder, media member and web developer on teams 200B, 74747J, 200X and this year, 200H. Outside of robotics, I co-lead the Leaside Chronicle newspaper and co-lead Stage Crew. My goal this year is to usurp the current lead programmer and claim the title for my own, or bring 200H to worlds. Whichever comes first. Graduation marks the end of my LanceBotics career, so I want to make sure to go out with a BANG! Worlds, here we come!

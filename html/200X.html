                                200X is LanceBotics' Varsity team. Our team, consisting of the most veteran members as well as being the largest team on LanceBotics, qualified for the 2019 VEX World Championship this past season as the only team from Toronto to participate. 200X, whose members’ have World Championship experience ready to be exercised in Regional and Provincial competitions through scouting, strategy, building and programming the robot to the international level.

                                200X has qualified for the 2020 VEX World Championship through Robot Skills at the 2020 Ontario VRC Provincial Championship where they placed 4th in Skills with a total score of 145. In the two seasons of our team’s existence, we have received seven awards, putting us on the same footing as the former highest achieving LanceBotics team 200A, who received the same number of awards in double the seasons.
                                
                                <br><br>
                                
                                The base of 200X’s success comes from our passion, team chemistry and hard work. All 21 members of the team regularly participate at work sessions, with roles ranging from building, programming, scout planning, photography, as well as the website. Every work session, whether at lunch or afterschool, we follow a schedule that organizes members into roles to allow work to be completed efficiently. At competitions, each member has an important role to play, by scouting the matches, scouting alliances and opposing teams, directly competing through drive team, taking pictures, maintaining the robot after every match, or strategizing for the upcoming matches. Everyone’s dedication is apparent and each member is a vital component to our well-oiled machine. And though it may be large, our organization as a team allows us to productively perform at every competition.
                                
                                <br><br>
                                
                                The members of 200X do not only share their success amongst themselves, but regularly give back to the Leaside community as well as the VEX community. During the 2018-2019 Turning Point Season, we established the VEX Ontario Discord Server, which allowed teams from all over Ontario to converse and share ideas about each other's robots. 200X also is a founding member of the 6 Alliance, which is a group of 20 teams, 19 of which qualified for the World Championship this past season. The alliance, originally started in Ontario alone last year, has expanded to countries as far as Australia, so that allianced teams can share ideas and strategize for the upcoming World Championship. This season alone, the Alliance has already collectively received over 50 awards.

                                In addition, two of our members work part-time at RoboEDU, an organization that provides younger kids in Leaside as well as other parts of the province with the opportunity to build and program robots. Our members work as mentors to provide help to kids and pass on their robotics experience from VEX.

                                This season we are fueled and determined to make it past simply qualifying for the World Championship, but to also make it to Freedom Hall, which is the international stage of the entire VEX Robotics Competition for the teams that perform the best at the World Championship.  Our motto, “Consistency and repeatability is the key to success.”, is our mantra to strive for excellence and achieve this goal. With our amazing members -- experienced or new -- we hope for the best, not only for ourselves, but for our fellow LanceBotics teams as well. We hope our robot, dubbed “I mean it works!”, performs to our expectations as well!

I am currently in my senior year and started VEX in grade 9 and have had a drive and passion for it ever since. My personal goal after making worlds last year, is to teach all the new members we accepted this year about how to be great builders, so that they may continue the LanceBotics legacy once I am gone. Before I leave, I would really like to win worlds this year.

                                    I am on the cross country, track and swim teams in school. This season, my goal
                                    is to win at least one of the many Online Challenges so that my team can qualify
                                    for the 2020 VEX World Championship! This is my last year of high school, and I plan

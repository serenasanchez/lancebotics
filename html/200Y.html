                                    Hey everyone! My name is David and this is my second year on the Leaside robotics team. 
                                    I’m on 200Y and I am a builder and programmer. My goal this season is to learn more 
                                    about robotics and to help 200Y as much as possible. Outside of robotics, I am a part 
                                    of the Leaside Health Science Club (HOSA) and the Ski Club. In my free time, I like to 
                                    bike, ski and travel. So far I met a bunch of new friends and developed multiple skills.

                                    an extra year of highschool at Leaside! I am a builder, and a graphic designer for 200Y. Last year, 
                                    I created a logo made specifically for 200X. Aside from robotics, I co-run the trivia club at 
                                    Leaside called “Reach for the Top”. This year, I would love for our team to win the VEX Worlds

                                    the competition in provincials and making it to worlds, and maybe 
                                    even win at that but there are no promises cause you have to work 
                                    hard and have dedication in order to get anywhere near that 
                                    position. To conclude, I hope to have a great season of working 
                                    towards our goals but also to have a little fun along the way. 
                                    As two people once said,  “Why so serious?” and “All work and 
                                    no play make Jack a dull boy”.

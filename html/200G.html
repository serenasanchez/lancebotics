                                200G is LanceBotics' all-girls VEX Robotics team. Our team consists of 12 
                                girls ranging from grades 10-12, all dedicated to immersing ourselves 
                                within robotics, the VEX community, and the stressful but incredibly 
                                rewarding competition VEX brings.

                                <br><br>

                                We are here to challenge the stigma around all-girls robotics teams. We 
                                are here to demonstrate -- not only to the VEX community -- but to 
                                ourselves that we are just as capable of working hard, learning lots, 
                                and succeeding as a team. We are here to prove that our awards are not 
                                the result of us being all-girls, but from our consistent dedication, 
                                determination, and genuine desire to learn. 

                                <br><br>

                                Change Up is 200G’s third year in VEX, with Turning Point being 
                                our team’s rookie season. 200G all started with our original co-captains, 
                                Sylvia Gehring and Crystal Jin. Both girls were involved in Lancebotics 
                                and VEX for two years prior to the founding of 200G, but they both 
                                became aware of something significant about robotics: there was an 
                                incredibly disproportionate amount of males and females on the team, 
                                and it was becoming more common for females to join the team, come for 
                                a couple of build sessions, and quit. They came to the realization that 
                                being a part of a co-ed team may feel especially daunting for girls who 
                                had no prior experience in robotics, and that they may feel worried 
                                about being judged by other team members for not understanding how VEX 
                                works. This made sense to Sylvia and Crystal as to why after a couple 
                                of build sessions, some girls may leave the team. After coming to this 
                                understanding, they agreed to start a new all-girls team under the 
                                Lancebotics organization, with the goal of providing an environment 
                                where girls do not need to be worried about being judged for what they 
                                do not understand and where girls may feel comfortable learning with 
                                each other. So, 200G was born. Our journey during the Turning Point 
                                season was a blast, from late night build sessions in Crystal’s basement 
                                to ranking 15th as a rookie team at Ontario Provincials to receiving 
                                the highest robot skills rank out of all four Lancebotics teams to 
                                winning the design award, judges award, and build award. Turning Point 
                                was an outstanding season that set the foundation for 200G’s VEX 
                                journey. And now, we’re coming back for more. 200G is ready to take on the field for another 
                                season. We are ready for another year of hard work, perseverance, 
                                friendships, and tears, and we are ready to demonstrate to the world 
                                what this all-girls team from Toronto is capable of.

                                    Hey, my name is Angel You and is my second year of VEX Robotics. I am 
                                    both a builder and programmer on 200G, as well as a co-captain. Other than robotics, I am involved 
                                    in rugby, lacrosse and fast pitch at school. Outside of school, I like to 
                                    do karate, play music, take pictures and learn new languages. This season,

                                    friends :)

                                    enjoy art and reading. My goal for this year is to learn how to build

                                    cello. I also like to read books. I guess my goal would be to experience

                                    competitions in our engineering notebook. Outside of LanceBotics, 
                                    I am the president of Leaside’s Arts Council, a junior editor in 
                                    the school Chronicle, and a member of the Drama Club, Yearbook 
                                    Committee, and Stage Crew. I joined LanceBotics as an attempt 
                                    to try something new and be a part of something big. This year, 
                                    I hope to help my team qualify for Worlds and make new friends

                                    will be my third year on the team, but my first as a captain. Out of 
                                    school, I like to skateboard and 
                                    play video games. This year, my goal is to soak in as much knowledge as 
                                    possible, and be the best captain possible for my team. Although I 
                                    still have another year left in robotics I still plan to make this year 
                                    a fun and memorable experience!

                                    Hello There!!! I'm Mubashir Abbas, and I am programmer for 200K. 
                                    This is my second year on the VEX Robotics Team. Alongside 
                                    robotics, I am a private tutor and an assistant teacher at a 
                                    weekend school. When I'm not programming or teaching, I enjoy 
                                    playing video games with friends, sketching, making paper 
                                    models, and reading about history. I look forward to making 
                                    this year the best in every possible way, and helping 
                                    200K fight its way to the top!

                                    Hey they're, my name is Owen and this is my second year on robotics. 
                                    I’m in grade 12 and so far know how to use 2 coding languages which are 
                                    python and java. My role in 200K is as a programmer. My goals for this 
                                    season are to understand as much as possible about the new coding 
                                    language and try and take us to worlds. I’ve heard great things about 
                                    robotics and I'm excited to compete, hopefully win and get to share 
                                    a couple laughs with all of you. C-ya later alligator.
